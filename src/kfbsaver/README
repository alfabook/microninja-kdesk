A very simple frame buffer screen saver for Kdesk
-------------------------------------------------

Implementing a screen saver in Kdesk is a bit tricky, because
we depend on Minecraft, and it seems to draw directly to the framebuffer.

A bit of background on the RPi framebuffer:

  http://elinux.org/RPi_Framebuffer

This means we need to have a screen saver that draws directly
to this buffer on the topmost layer to overlap on top of Minecraft. 
This screen saver attempts to do this but *still* at this point fails for Minecraft.

Nevertheless it succeeds on the rest of the system apps.
The code is based on the recipes found on these set of articles:

 http://raspberrycompote.blogspot.ie/2012/12/low-level-graphics-on-raspberry-pi-part_9509.html

Additionally it listens for events from the keyboard and mouse,
so any activity the user sends to the system will effectively kill the screen saver
returning the user to the Kano Desktop.

Keys on kdeskrc that control the screen saver are:

ScreenSaverTimeout: x   (expressed in seconds)
ScreenSaverProgra: y    (binary program to draw on the screen: kfbsaver provides this)
